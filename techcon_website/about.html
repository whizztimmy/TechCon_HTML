                    <p>Dr. Todd Younkin is the CEO and President of Semiconductor Research Corporation. Appointed by the Board in 2020, Younkin has transformed SRC into a vibrant powerhouse responsible for nearly $100M annually in university-based research sponsored by 25 international companies and 2 U.S. government agencies. Todd's critical initial accomplishment as CEO was to oversee the development and publication of the 2030 Decadal Plan for Semiconductors, released in partnership with the Semiconductor Industry Association in 2021, which bolstered the case for the passage of the CHIPS and SCIENCE ACT of 2022 on August 9th, 2022.</p>
